		<em>Why?</em> Authentication with Steam is needed to verify that you
		are reporting your Steam Fruitcake&trade; for your account. Steam
		Fruitcake&trade; will only retrieve information from your Steam
		profile for the duration of the session. When you report a fruitcake
		Steam Fruitcake&trade; will register your Steam ID with the game you
		selected, and optionally include your steam name and avatar.
		Information about your Steam Library and Steam Inventory will be
		removed from our system as soon as you log out or when your session
		automatically expires. No information which is retrieved will be
		handed to third parties.
